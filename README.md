# Beckn-enabled Reputation Infrastructure

The Reputation Infrastructure is a application that will shape the new form of rating or reputation where the reputation will be dependent on both qualitative and quantitative attributes present in the sectors that will help them to build a transparent reputation for the organization or an individual. User can search for them by applying filters based upon different attributes. 
<br>
<br>
It includes  Core Reputation by summing up various sectors that can provide reputation to any sectors/ individuals, people can upload their Reputation, which will be stored in their unique Rept. ID which can be accessible easily and people can see and showcase their reputation.
<br>
<br>
Its built to make a transparent and effective reputation for an organization or an individual , to provide a transparent infrastructure for the conventional rating system. It will help users to search the particular service or organization based on the attributes they need the most, by fetching the data from the reputation. 
<br>
<br>
It can be helpful to authenticate the Reputation/Rating sectors by verifying the reputation, or that vague reputation and rating system by introducing transparency and trust. Users would be able to get the service which they desire the most.

## Why Reputation Infrastructure?
Reputation/Rating plays a crucial role, and are essential in the service industries to build trust between provider and customer and helps customer to make good-decision. Reputation or Rating system is almost used by every service providing companies like Amazon, Zomato, Flipkart, Urban Company and etc. Many use the rating system to get the feedback on their employee behavior, delivery partners and so on. So, that they can use the feedback ratings to improve the overall product quality and services to deliver the best services to their customers.
<br>
Whenever we select any product we see its ratings and customer feedback before buying it or whenever we select any service from choosing a Restaurant, Hotel, Salon or any other service we still rely on the ratings or the customer feedback before making a choice to make a good decision.
<br>
The current reputation and rating infrastructure faces several challenge like Overreliance on Numeric Ratings, Interdependency Challenges, Lack of Verification, Sample Bias and Competitor Manipulation.
<br>
To tackle the above stated challenges and to have a fair and trustworthy Reputation System, in this project we will be working on a decentralized and beckn-enabled reputation system, that will provide <b>Trust and Transparency</b>, <b> User Control and Ownership</b>, <b>Resilience and Security</b>, <b>Interoperability and Portability</b>, and <b>Enhanced Fairness and Accountability</b>.

## Features 
- Users would be able to search for the service or organisation by using the filter attributes which they need the most and will get the best results according to reputation.
